The project is a program of two-way communication between Server and Client. The Client (Students) connects to the Server and are given two options for the hacks: 
i) Generate ii) Request

Both options would lead to choosing categorical options for the hacks in school and students are provided to generate or look-up the hacks given by other or previous undergraduate students. 

### Generate
'Prompt' in Hack & 'Store' in Category.

### Request
'Prompt' in Category & Hacks are revealed in order.

Each request of the hacks would prompt an upvote or downvote for the hack as an indication of how useful the hack would be for the student. 

Conditions set:
1. 'generated' or 'retrieved' must be written to execute program.
2. Generating hack would limit to a constant maximum length (10 for each category).
3. If reached to more than 3 downvotes then the Hack would be deleted.

Hack-A-Long!!!
